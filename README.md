## [BTree](https://github.com/r96922081/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm/blob/main/DSA_C%23/BTree/B%2BTree.cs)
The B-tree generalizes the binary search tree, allowing for nodes with more than two children.
The B-tree is well suited for storage systems that read and write relatively large blocks of data, 
such as databases and file systems
